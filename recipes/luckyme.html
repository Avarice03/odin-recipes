    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lucky Me Pancit Canton is a popular instant noodle here in the Philippines. 
    It is easy and quick to cook while tasting great at the same time. 
    I think that it is the only "dish" I can cook by myself (but I'm good with it!).</p>
        <p>Warning: I recommend that you should only eat instant noodles once or twice a month 
    if you care about your health.</p>
